## Modern day dark web princesse's
>Manga anime has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Artistic styles, story telling the way information is provided with in-depth detail and infographics about each specific character is something that creates a sense of deep immersion, and a pseudo sense of rapport with a 2D fictional character allowing for countless things to have in common like: blood type age or activities & past times. I try to provide novel level descriptions with infographic visual data story telling style
