## INTRODUCTION
The Next Billion Users Web 3.0 along with the natural evolution of technology being adapted into all working industries will put a much greater demand and availability for entertainment industries have begun fighting to secure and lock down creative content creators for the purpose of creating entertainment for the next billion users more and more people are logging on and discovering and creating new niche circles everyday. Thanks to web 3.0 authenticating creative works of art will make it easier for artist to be recognised this new form of transparency will help mitigate intellectual property theft. As a creative myself I have never been more excited taking ownership of my talents and skills instead of being taken advantage of and being bound to a contract with no hope of escape like some of the horror stories that float around the industry I believe the new era of web 3,0 will bring about collaborations that won’t have to compete with major conglomerates. Highly designed materials weather physical or digital versus industry scale mass produced products. Creators and creative and gamers will be like nascar drivers dawning multiple brands when games become more difficult and incentives are created for completing or participating Creative public figures sharing brand images projecting fun and wholesomeness teaching beneficial core values corporate rosters of gamers and creatives competing for financial gain and notoriety

Levels of complexity in NFT’s 
-Mutable when traded.     
-Attached to blockchain Recreatable and immutable
(DeafBeef entropy collection degrades and becomes fragmented with artifacts and distortion)
(Attributes can be anything ranging from colour shape design or sound of the nft)
-Mutable attributes depending on input
     •Interactive (Push button animations)
     •Triggered when 2 or more in 1 collection 
-Mutable attributes depending on specific source
     •Blockchain gas fees
     •Season
-Special trading restrictions
     •Can only be traded on specific days like full moons***
     •Can only be traded at specific times of the day afternoon 11:11am to 1:11pm

### Biometrics
There are many different types of biometrics in this paper. I am going to highlight and emphasize the ones that I think will be most impactful. The use of multiple devices in unison provide deeper levels of sensor-data as well as higher levels of accuracy in readings.
