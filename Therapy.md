Dear [Therapist's Name],
I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding my Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) treatment. Despite my repeated attempts to communicate the unique challenges I face due to the differences between my interpersonal and social anxiety, I feel my concerns have been consistently overlooked. This has led to significant harm, delays, and deterioration in various aspects of my life.
### Professional vs. Personal Contexts
In professional settings, particularly in customer service, I excel due to the structured and objective nature of interactions. These environments have clear protocols and defined expectations, which allow me to perform effectively. However, my struggles with interpersonal anxiety, especially in personal and intimate relationships, present a different set of challenges. These interactions require subjective interpretation and understanding of social cues, which I find extremely difficult.
### Impact on Therapy and Daily Life
The current CBT approach seems to ignore these critical differences. This oversight has not only rendered the therapy ineffective in personal contexts but has also exacerbated my anxiety. The strategies that work well in professional settings fail to address the nuanced and subjective nature of personal relationships. Consequently, my anxiety has worsened, leading to significant delays in my education, financial stability, and overall well-being.
### Consequences of Ignored Concerns
The refusal to consider my specific needs has forced me to seek alternative routes, often with detrimental effects. The rigid application of CBT has felt more like a weaponized tool rather than a therapeutic aid, leading to:
- **Academic Delays:** My inability to manage interpersonal anxiety has caused significant setbacks in my academic progress.
- **Financial Strain:** The delays in school have resulted in financial instability, further compounding my stress and anxiety.
- **Mental Health Deterioration:** The ongoing struggle and lack of appropriate support have led to episodes of self-harm and an overreliance on medication to cope with the resulting distress.
### Urgent Need for Tailored Approaches
I implore you to take my concerns seriously and consider a tailored approach to my therapy. Specifically, I need strategies that address the subjective aspects of interpersonal anxiety, distinct from the techniques that work in structured, professional environments. This might include:
- Role-playing exercises to practice personal interactions in a safe environment.
- Mindfulness techniques to help me stay grounded during subjective interpersonal exchanges.
- Acknowledgment and integration of my feedback into the therapy plan to ensure it addresses my specific needs.
### Conclusion
The current CBT approach has caused more harm than benefit, delaying my progress and leading to severe personal consequences. I urge you to reassess and adjust my treatment plan to reflect the complexity of my situation, considering both my strengths in professional settings and my challenges in personal relationships. Your understanding and support in this matter are crucial for my recovery and overall well-being.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to discussing a more effective and personalized approach to my therapy.
Sincerely,
Bitwayiki Elias (Elias Bitwayiki)
