## Crowdfunding:
websites: Crowdfunding is a great way to quickly raise funds for your business. You essentially get funded by many different anonymous people in return for equity. While [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/en-ca) and [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) are great for product-based startups, most new startups go through seed-based crowdfunding rounds on websites like:

## Sponsorships:

[CrunchBase - UnicORN List ‚ú®](https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/unicorn-list/5ae6a6d1-a2db-4bc9-8717-7b71f441cdaa/identifiers)

1. Research potential sponsors. Look at your existing supporters. Evaluate each one to see if their goal and interests align with your values and audience‚Äîor if they could help you find other new sponsors. 
2. Tell your organization's story. What makes your organization special? Define your key pitch elements and weave them together to tell a story that will appeal to potential sponsors. 
3. Provide sponsor incentives. Sweeten the deal by communicating what a sponsor will get out of the partnership (and how it‚Äôll boost their visibility). Include examples of their organization will be featured, like:¬† 
    * Marketing and promotional collateral¬† 
    * Branded videos 
    * Social media content 
    * Event swag and goodies 
4. Reach out to established companies. Partner with established companies that have a positive reputation, have built trust and can boost your organization‚Äôs profile. 
5. Use data to legitimize your pitch. Data is everything. Don‚Äôt forget to take those important insights from your audience and feature them in the pitch.
    * Twitch Growth Data 
    * WordPress Growth Data
    * RoutineHub
6. Find the right contact. Make sure you know who the right contact is. Often, this can be someone in the marketing department. 
7. Build a connection over time. A good relationship always starts with a strong foundation. Take time to get to know your potential sponsor and build a connection over shared values and concerns.¬† 
8. Follow up. Whether it‚Äôs a problem of timing or funding, sometimes a ‚Äúno‚Äù is just a ‚Äúno for right now‚Äù. It‚Äôs worthwhile keeping these contacts on hand to follow up with in the future.

# Assets
* A successful fundraiser (e.g., walk, run, gala, etc.). 
* A large donor [or membership] base.

# Defining Your Audience
[Socail Blade](https://socialblade.com)
* Social media analytics: Metrics like impressions, engagement, and reach are important here. If you have a strong social following or high engagement with your content, show this to your sponsors.¬† 
* Demographic information: Use information like age, location, occupation, education, etc. to segment your audience into valuable groups.
* Membership engagement surveys: Engagement surveys can be a great source of data. They can reveal your audience‚Äôs interests, needs, and wants. Use this information to position your sponsorship pitch and show how a sponsorship would be a great match.
* Google Analytics: Page visits, website traffic, and popular pages are all examples of the kind of information you can find through Google Analytics that can sculpt the profile of your audience. 
* ¬†Post-event surveys:¬†Another kind of survey, but this hones in on what has made your past events a success. Use this information to understand what your audience likes and how your sponsor can provide value.
